This is my first repository of Git-Hub.

It containts small codes in the programming language: Java, C, C++ and Python. This repository was made for fun and for practicing my git and github knowledge.

As I progress in my journey through the world of **Data Structures and Algorithms,** I plan to update my repository with new code. This will help me catch up on concepts afterwards and revisit them. It will also help me in brushing up on my Github command skills.

Thank you everyone, who visited my page and giving my projects time.
